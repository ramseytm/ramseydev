As an excuse to play around with some new development frameworks and tools I'm starting a new ongoing monthly series, Tool of the Month! Each month I'm going to provide a basic overview of a development tool or framework that I've been playing around with including my intial impressions and recommendations. So, with that introduction complete let's get started! This month's tool is [Atom - a hackable text editor](https://atom.io/)!


# What is it?

Atom is a text editor that bosts multi-language support, autocompletion, a package manager, cross-platform support and deep extensibility. Beyond basic syntax highlighting and formatting users can add intellisense, compilation and autocompletion by extending the editor with core and community developed packages that integrate third-party utilities. It runs on Elctron which allows cross-platform applications to be developed with html5, javascript and css. This makes it easy to extend and stylize Atom using the web technologies that many people use Atom to work with. It is also completely [open source](https://github.com/atom/atom).

# What's good about it?

Full disclosure, I haven't used Atom on any large projects yet so my impressions only go skin deep. That said, I've been using it exclusively while working through some simple react/redux apps along with some existing typescript code and I think there is a lot to like in Atom. For web development specifically I can see it becoming a main contender as my editor of choice for forseeable future. Atom packs a lot of features for a relatively new product.

## The package manager

As a [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) user I've been spoiled by the extensibility provided by a well integrated package manager. Coupled with a large repository it becomes one of the main qualifications for a great modern editor in my opinion.

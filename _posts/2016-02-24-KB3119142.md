![Windows Update Exception](http://tylerramsey.net/assets/201602/KB3119142.jpg "Windows Update Exception")
{: style="text-align: center"}

So you're running Windows 10 just plugging along until you see that familiar notification pop up letting you know that you've got updates pending. "Great..." you say, and proceed to run the update and get the annoying notification off the screen. The update installs and everything is right in the world again and you continue plugging along until you log off for the day (or night if you're like me). Next time you log in, you're greeted to yet another Windows update pending however this time you notice something very familiar..."wasn't that the update I just installed?"

## The Issue

You're not wrong. In fact if you look in your update history you may see something similar to the image at the top of this post. The update is KB3119142 otherwise known as the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679) and for some reason it continually installs itself successfully. I found that amusing and mildly infuriating. It almost annoys me more to have an update that continually prompts when it's successful each time as opposed to when it actually fails.

## The Fix

Fortunately the fix is easy or at least it was in my case. You'll see a lot of people stating you'll need to uninstall the Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable from the control panel and install it from scratch from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679). I wasn't required to go through even that much trouble. All that was required was to simply select the redistributable in the control panel window -> select "Change" -> select "Repair". The installer repairs the redistributable and no more annoying windows update notification!

 Well it's finally happened. I'm publishing a site of my own. It seems a little silly in retrospect that it's taken me this long to get a site up and running. I still have a lot of finishing touches to add to it yet but I figure if I don't get it up here now I'll just keep tinkering and never actually publish the thing.

I intend this site to provide me a place to shove a bunch of my thoughts and ideas out there which are usually lost in my hum-drum work day. Hopefully some one out there will find some of it interesting but if not then no harm, no foul I suppose. 

Anyway, this post is mostly just an excuse to share the waiving bear gif.

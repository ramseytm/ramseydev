I'm a little late with this one as we're now halfway through January but each year I like to look back on some of the interesting things I've read or seen. I'm constantly reading blogs and articles throughout my day, some related to work and some that just catch my eye. When I read one that holds my attention for longer than 10 minutes I usually bookmark it so I can come back to it later or maybe give it a second glance. I've gone through those bookmarks below with a short summary of each in case anyone else finds them interesting. So without further ado, the list!

## Peteris Krumin's top 100 books

[http://www.catonmat.net/blog/top-100-books-part-one/](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/top-100-books-part-one/ "Peteris Krumin's top 100 books")

Here Peteris Krumin lists out his top 100 books about programming, computers and science. Admittedly, I have a hard time pulling myself away from fiction for long enough to delve into reference materials. However, I've made it a goal to spend some more time reading for learning than for pleasure and Peteris' list has some great titles to that end. It's worth looking over for it's sheer size as well.

## Rosetta Code

[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code "Rosetta Code")

Rosetta Code is a really neat site that I can't believe I hadn't heard of until this year. It provides a list of programmable solutions to a wide variety of tasks in a variety of programming languages. Beyond the fact that it's just plain neat, I found it very useful when I wanted to see a small usage example of a programming language I'm unfamiliar with.

## The Humble Programmer

Dijkstra's 1972 Turing lecture stressing the importance of approaching the complex tasks presented to programmers each day with a great deal of respect and humility. I was of course familiar with it before this year, however I had never actually read it. If you haven't read it, you really should.

## Full-Stack Redux Tutorial

[http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html "Redux tutorial")

Tero Parviainen provides a huge tutorial covering the Redux stack and it's associated frameworks from start to finish. I was fortunate to stumble upon his write up while looking to learn the redux basics myself. This is a great one if you're looking for the complete "story" of the Redux stack.

## Five most famous Software Bugs

Amusing write up of some pretty big whoopsies made by software developers. The associated [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10587133) is a pretty good read as well for some additional stories.

## Awesome curated lists

Awesome is a huge list of lists linking you to subject you're interested in on GitHub. I found things I didn't even think I was interested in knowing about on this list and I'm sure you will to.

So you try to install .NET 3.5 on your Windows 8.1+ machine and you run into the error above. Annoyingly I ran into this error recently after doing a fresh install of Windows 10. If you're like me, my first thought before actually resorting to looking up the error is to try installing the framework from a stand-alone installer. Of course, if you try that you'll see the installer will simply fire up windows update and attempt to install it as a feature leading to the same error as before. With that knowledge in hand, I took the next step of actually researching a solution.

I found that this error can mean a multitude of things and has several solutions so be sure to check out the [support article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2734782) about it. The solution that ended up working for me was performing an off-line install so I'm going to provide quick write up of the steps required to do that.

## Getting the installation media

In order to perform the install without the need to go on-line to Windows update for the resources required you'll need the install media of your Windows version. This could be on a DVD, on a USB key or in an ISO image. In my case I needed to download the ISO since I didn't have the physical media. Simply [download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10ISO) a copy of the windows 10 ISO. This image will contain the files we need to install .NET 3.5 off-line.

## Mounting the image

Once the ISO has completed downloading we need to mount it so we can access the files it contains. Fortunately, Windows now supports native mounting of ISO images. Simply select your ISO file, click the "Manage" tab in the file explorer and then click on "Mount". This will mount the image to virtual drive you'll see noted in the file path in the file explorer. Take note of the drive letter as we'll be using it in the next step, as an example mine was "G:\".

## Install .NET 3.5 from the media

Now that you have the ISO mounted we need to open up an *Administrator command prompt*. When that's open we need to run the following command:

{% highlight batch %}
DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /Source:D:\sources\sxs /All /LimitAccess
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the drive letter "D:\" after the "/Source" switch. Remember to replace that drive letter with the letter that points to your mounted media in the previous step. Assuming all goes well that should successfully install .NET 3.5 and you should be good to go.

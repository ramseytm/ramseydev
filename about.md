# Hello there and welcome to my little space of the net! 

A little about me, I'm a software engineer in Columbus, Ohio. This is my personal blog that I use to share my thoughts about anything and everything that I find interesting. Most of the time the topics I discuss revolve around the technologies I use on a day-to-day basis working in I.T. as a software engineer. That said, I'm also a big reader, gamer and geniune techology enthusiast so you'll see all sorts of different topics discussed here.

During my day job I work with the Microsoft Stack, more specifically ASP.NET, MVC, Web API and WCF with a little powershell sprinkled in. At home I tend to bounce between being a Windows developer and a Unix zealot. I also love dabbling with python and programming for embedded devices so I hope to use this blog as an excuse to expirement with those technologies more substantially.

When I'm not working or programming I enjoy spending time with my family and getting outside when I can. I'm also big on food and love to cook. I also enjoy GIFs as you might have noticed.

Most of what you see here isn't necessarily original (what on the web is?) but I find writing my thoughts down helps me keep my sanity and aids me in learning. Hopefully you'll find some of it interesting and if not well...at least it's free.
